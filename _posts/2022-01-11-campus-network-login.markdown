Though universities will usually provide internet access, Captive Portal authorization is required to use the campus network. In my university, the network will reset daily. So I have to log in many times every day to make my phone, laptop or tablet connect to the internet.

It is quite disturbing to enter a username and password to log in when I hurried to the classroom in haste. That is why I need a tool to finish the auth process as soon as I connect.
